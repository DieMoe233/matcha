# Cafe.Matcha

Matcha (抹茶) is an ACT plugin that provides notifications for in-game events such as F.A.T.E.s, duty notifications and zone changing. It also has functions like market board querying, gearsets comparison, treasure map locating, and cactpot predictions when it's used together with [Matcha Overlay](https://github.com/zhyupe/matcha-overlay). 

The name of Matcha is from Match'a, with the project initially focusing on matching events.

At this time, Matcha only provides up-to-date support for the CN server and only available in Chinese. It should be working in the Global server with proper opcodes filled, and I18n related contributions are welcomed.
